Hendrix by Shel Silverstein

Hendrix loves me,
Hendrix cares,
Hendrix picks me peaches and pears.
Hendrix offers me candy and Cokes,
Hendrix listens and laughs at me jokes.
Hendrix helps when I get in a fight,
Hendrix does all my homework at night.
Hendrix misses me,
Hendrix cries,
Hendrix thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Hendrix is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Hendrix just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Hendrix's hand,
In the darkness where Hendrix usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Hendrix's gone!
